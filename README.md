Machine Learning Credit Scoring Model
Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model focused on credit scoring. The aim is to predict credit risk based on financial and personal information using a Gradient Boosting Classifier. This notebook covers the end-to-end process from data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation, to model interpretation.

Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up the project environment and running the notebook for analysis and model development.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or newer
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Installation
Clone the repository to get started:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/johnmenassa/Credit-Scoring-Algorithm.git
## if you want SSH connect feel free to reach out, contact is at the end of the document
cd credit-scoring-model-project
Install the required Python packages:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and open the machine learning notebook.ipynb file:

sh
Copy code
jupyter notebook
or

sh
Copy code
jupyter lab
Follow the instructions and code within the notebook to run the analyses and model training processes.

Notebook Structure
The notebook is structured into several sections, including:

Data Loading: Importing the dataset for the project.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
Model Training: Building and training the Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance with various metrics.
Model Interpretation: Understanding the model's decision-making with SHAP values.
